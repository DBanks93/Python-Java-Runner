# Python-Java-Runner

This is a fancyish java runner where what you can do is open, edit, save, compile and run (.className) java files, however you can only enter one input (as I don't have the time to implement multiple due to studying).

Feel free to take this code, edit it use it or ideally learn somethings from it :)
